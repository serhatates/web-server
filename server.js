    express feature => middleware: makes it really easy to run a specific function for all of your routes or just for some.

// sense require auth is going to run first before the body 
// the order you define them in is important
// if i were to put this use call down below the about route, it would never run
// when you call app.use you adding app level middleware, it's gonna get called every page requested and every route hit

/**
    Middleware can be confusing, so let's make it as simple as possible. Middleware is nothing more than one JavaScript function. That's it.

    The function gets passed into app.use(someFunction); and now it's registered to the application and will get called every time a request comes through.

    Now onto the things you can do inside of middleware. You function should expect to get 3 arguments:

    1) req - This stores the request info like the url thats being requested and any data that may have been sent along to the server
    2) res - This object lets you respond to the request to send back to the user.
    3) next - This is a function that gets called when the middleware is done. It lets express know to move on to the next middleware function or onto the final request handler.

    Now middleware can do ANYTHING. But that's not useful to know! 
    I more realistic example would be middleware that helps authenticate users.
    You might use the req argument to get the users auth token or email/password. 
    If the user was not authenticated you can use the res object to send an error back.
    If they are authenticated you can call next to let them into the app.

/**
    API is short for application programming interface.
    In a general sense, and API is how a programmer can interact with some library or system. 
    For example, most of the 3rd party modules have an API (a way the user can interact with the module).
    In the case of the Todo API, it's an HTTP API. Meaning that instead of calling functions or methods, you're making HTTP requests to specific urls. 
    It's still an API though. It's a way for a developer to interact with the system.
